## Data Analysis & Modelling (Python, R) 

**[Modelling Changes in Journey Time Accessibility by Public Transport](/sample_page)**
<br><br>
The aim of this model was to forecast and better understand how bus journey times change in response to different bus services, frequencies, and bus priority infrastructure. Broadly, it aimed to understand how accessibility, measured by travel time, would change under different scenarios. Travel time matrices were developed for each scenario, building on forecast land use and employment changes and the impact of planned bus priority infrastructure. The matrices were mapped via Python geospatial libraries for further analysis and client engagement.

**[Estimating the Emissions of Plublic Transport Services and Operations](http://example.com/)**
<br><br>
To understand the cumulativ emissions generated from different bus service scenarios, a model was developed to estimate and evaluate the tailpipe emissions associated with different bus service scenarios developed for future operations in the Western Bay of Plenty. This involved using the European Environment Agency EMEP model, bus fleet data, and GTFS with R scripting to calculate CO2, Nox, and PM emissions associated with service operations. R plotting libraries were used to visualise the results and demosntrate the emissions profile by time of day and vehilce fleet.

## Visualisations & Web Applications

**[Understanding Changes to PT Service Modifications](http://example.com/)**
<br><br>
This is a useful interactive web application tool that was created to visually illustrate changes to bus routes and other service modifications in the Western Bay of Plenty. Various route statistics are shown - such as route length, annual operating cost, kilometres driven per year, and forecast average daily PT demand - allowing the user to understand the wider imapacts that service modifications will have. The application is dynamically connected to the data sources, meaning that new data is refreshed with each option.

_Tools used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, Streamlit_
